# Introduction 

Deface$ is a mobile app designed specifically for homeless people to get free food. The idea is inspired by the philosophy of cynicism 'Deface the currency (or coinage)' where Diogenes, a Greek philosopher took the idea and decided to deface the established cultural, social standards.  

This app is designed for a 3-day Hackathon event within the theme of money. I'm not entirely sure if it fits perfectly, though I'd argue money plays a role in almost everything. The idea inspired me to change what we often call 'leftovers' into something valuable for those who need it.

# Install 

For some reasons, the app only works well on IOS. I have tested on my Android phone but some many functionalities are missing and cause bugs.
